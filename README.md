# Add custom section to single product page

Product pages usually include default sections - product summary, tabs with detailed information about product and related products. But what if you also need to include custom section, displaying for example featured products? Here's a solution.

**Usage:** add the snippet from custom-section-single-product.php to your child theme's functions.php file.

*Please let me know if the snippet still works. Also, any comments or improvements are always welcomed.*
